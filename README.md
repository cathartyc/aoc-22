# Advent of Code 2022

My own attempts to solve the AoC daily puzzles, in python 3.10.

The goals for this year's edition are:
- learn to write better 'pythonic' code
- do it faster
- get familiar with the US layout (just for fun)
- rely less on third-party code ({*DIY*}-minus-{*don't reinvent the wheel*} ruleset)

Furthermore, I'm open to receive comments and criticisms - a.k.a. to be blasted for poor, unsafe and bad code lol - in order to improve, so feel free to do it :)
